# WEBRING OSW - Open Source Webring
I'm working on this project because there isn't a webring hosting service around that suits my needs. The existing scripts (some are great already) that allow you to manage a webring aren't supported on the webhost that currently hosts <a href="https://tuffgong.neocities.org">my stuff</a>. Thats why I will have to come up with a custom version. This approach might take me a while to finish though as I don't have plenty of time.  That's about it at the moment. More to come!
